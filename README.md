# dota-2-hero-colors

I created this tool to calculate the average color in each of the DOTA 2 hero portraits.

The .png files (in the full folder) are put onto a canvas so I can grab the image data.

I then loop through all pixels on that canvas and find the average the RGB color.

The results are in the dota2herocolors.json file and displayed at https://joshddunn.com/herocolors
