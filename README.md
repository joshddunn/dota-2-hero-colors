# dota-2-hero-colors

This is a tool I created to calculate the average color in each of the DOTA 2 hero portraits.

The .png files (in the full folder) are put onto a canvas I can grab image data.

I then loop through all pixels on that canvas and average the RGB color data.

The results can be found in the dota2herocolors.json file.

The results are displayed at https://joshddunn.com/herocolors
